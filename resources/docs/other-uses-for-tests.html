    Once you get used to writing automated tests, you will likely discover
    more uses for tests. Here are some examples.

      Typically, in a project that is developed using an agile process,
      such as Extreme Programming, the documentation cannot keep up with the
      frequent changes to the project's design and code. Extreme Programming
      demands <span class="emphasis"><em>collective code ownership</em></span>, so all
      developers need to know how the entire system works. If you are
      disciplined enough to consequently use "speaking names" for your tests
      that describe what a class should do, you can use PHPUnit's TestDox
      functionality to generate automated documentation for your project based
      on its tests. This documentation gives developers an overview of what
      each class of the project is supposed to do.
    </p>
<p>
      PHPUnit's TestDox functionality looks at a test class and all the test
      method names and converts them from camel case PHP names to sentences:
      <code class="literal">testBalanceIsInitiallyZero()</code> becomes "Balance is
      initially zero". If there are several test methods whose names only
      differ in a suffix of one or more digits, such as
      <code class="literal">testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative()</code> and
      <code class="literal">testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative2()</code>, the sentence
      "Balance cannot become negative" will appear only once, assuming that
      all of these tests succeed.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us take a look at the agile documentation generated for a
      <code class="literal">BankAccount</code> class:
    </p>
<pre class="screen"><strong class="userinput"><code>phpunit --testdox BankAccountTest</code></strong>
PHPUnit 5.3.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

BankAccount
 [x] Balance is initially zero
 [x] Balance cannot become negative</pre>
<p>
      Alternatively, the agile documentation can be generated in HTML or plain
      text format and written to a file using the <code class="literal">--testdox-html</code>
      and <code class="literal">--testdox-text</code> arguments.
    </p>

      Agile Documentation can be used to document the assumptions you make
      about the external packages that you use in your project. When you use
      an external package, you are exposed to the risks that the package will
      not behave as you expect, and that future versions of the package will
      change in subtle ways that will break your code, without you knowing it.
      You can address these risks by writing a test every time you make an
      assumption. If your test succeeds, your assumption is valid. If you
      document all your assumptions with tests, future releases of the
      external package will be no cause for concern: if the tests succeed,
      your system should continue working.
    </p>

<p>
      When you document assumptions with tests, you own the tests. The
      supplier of the package -- who you make assumptions about -- knows
      nothing about your tests. If you want to have a closer relationship
      with the supplier of a package, you can use the tests to communicate
      and coordinate your activities.
    </p>
<p>
      When you agree on coordinating your activities with the supplier of a
      package, you can write the tests together. Do this in such a way that
      the tests reveal as many assumptions as possible. Hidden assumptions are
      the death of cooperation. With the tests, you document exactly what you
      expect from the supplied package. The supplier will know the package is
      complete when all the tests run.
    </p>

      By using stubs (see the chapter on "Mock Objects", earlier in this book),
      you can further decouple yourself from the supplier: The job of the
      supplier is to make the tests run with the real implementation of the
      package. Your job is to make the tests run for your own code. Until
      such time as you have the real implementation of the supplied package,
      you use stub objects. Following this approach, the two teams can develop
      independently.
